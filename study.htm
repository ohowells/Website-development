				<h1>Why study with us</h1>
				<br />

				<p>
					This is a fantastic opportunity to join a new University which has been formed
				</p>
				<p>
					with the express purpose of offering its students the best opportunities to
				</p>
				<p>
					succeed and provide the best possible student experience.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Formed from the merger of two Universities with long and illustrious histories
				</p>
				<p>
					(the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport), the new
				</p>
				<p>
					University brings together five campuses based across south Wales.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					The new University maximises your chances of getting a good career when you graduate. We work with companies such as
				</p>
				<p>
					British Airways, General Electric, Sony and Tata. The University also works with the NHS and other public sector employers to
				</p>
				<p>
					train nurses, teachers and the police force.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Your experience here is very important to us. As well as investing money into academic facilities, we have also dedicated
				</p>
				<p>
					ourselves to improving your living environment. New Halls of residence and Students’ Union facilities have been built in
				</p>
				<p>
					recent years. The Union runs a great entertainment programme, as well as offering welfare support.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h3>In a nutshell, the university has:</h3>
